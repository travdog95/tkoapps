Services, when you participate in activities on the App or otherwise when you contact us. The
personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the
App, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect
may include the following: All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete
and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information. 2. WILL YOUR
INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE? In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply
with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.
We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis: Consent: We may
process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a
specific purpose. Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to
achieve our legitimate business interests. Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a
contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.
Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order
to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal
process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public
authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements). Vital Interests: We may
disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action
regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we
are involved. More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information
in the following situations: Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in
connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or

outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal

longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
longer than __________. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for

securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
is possible. 4. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS? In Short: We do not knowingly collect data
from or market to children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to

browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. 7. DO CALIFORNIA
